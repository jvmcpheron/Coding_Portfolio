                    I first really got interested in web-development when I saw my friend go through a 
                    fullstack web-development bootcamp. The way he was able to manipulate websites through 
                    code really piqued my interest, especially the front-end work. I decided to invest in 
                    Codecademy, a website that specializes in teaching the basics in a vartiety of different
                    forms of programming. Starting out, I wanted to learn the basics of Python, a programming 
                    language I already had some familiarity with. I then moved on and went through CSS and HTML.
                    Learning these languages opened up a creative side to me I didn't know I had. I explored
                    that creativity further with lessons in Color Design, and UX/UI Design. I even know how to make
                    a wireframe! I have already learned to love programming, and I am excited to move forawrd. 
                    I hope by the end of the summer 2022 I will have worked my way through JavaScript, React, and React
                    Native so that I can have a solid understanding of both web-development and mobile-development.
                    This portfolio displays the work I have done and continue to do!
